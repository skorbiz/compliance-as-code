# Risk Assessment Model
# Defines severity and probability scales for risk analysis

severity_levels:
  catastrophic:
    value: 5

    color: "#8B0000"
  critical:
    value: 4
    description: "Major disruption or significant data exposure"
    color: "#DC143C"
  moderate:
    value: 3
    description: "Partial disruption or limited data exposure"
    color: "#FFA500"
  minor:
    value: 2

    color: "#FFD700"
  negligible:
    value: 1

    value: 5
    description: "Expected to occur (>90%)"
    frequency: "Multiple times per year"
  likely:
    value: 4
    description: "Will probably occur (60-90%)"
    frequency: "Once per year"
  possible:
    value: 3

    frequency: "Once every 3-10 years"
  rare:
    value: 1
    description: "Exceptional circumstances (<10%)"
